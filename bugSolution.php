The solution is to always use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`) when comparing values in PHP to avoid unexpected type juggling issues.

```php
<?php
$str = '0';
$bool = false;

if ($str === $bool) {
  echo "Strings '0' and boolean false are equal using strict comparison\n";
} else {
  echo "Strings '0' and boolean false are not equal using strict comparison\n";
}
?>
```
Using strict comparison ensures that the data types are also compared, preventing this type of error.
